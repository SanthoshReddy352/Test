## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

**IMPORTANT: Run this first!**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to SQL Editor (left sidebar)

You're right, let's re-brand the platform to be "EventX" and remove all specific "IEEE" references.

Here are the complete, updated files. You can copy and paste the entire content for each file.

🎯 Key Features Explained
Dynamic Form Builder
Admins can create custom registration forms for each event:

Go to Admin → Events → Click event → "Edit Form"

Add fields: text, email, number, URL, dropdown, checkbox, textarea, date

Set field properties (label, required, options for dropdown)

Reorder fields using the "Move Up" / "Move Down" buttons.

Auto-Save: Your work is automatically saved to your browser session. If you refresh, the form will still be there.

Click "Save Form to Database" to make it final.

Club Profile Management
Normal admins (non-super-admins) can visit the "Club Profile" link in the navbar.

On this page, they can set their Club Name and Upload a Club Logo.

This information is then displayed on the homepage and on all EventCard components for events they create.

🔒 Security
Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables

Authenticated-only access to admin features

Public read for is_active events

Service role key used only on server-side

CORS configured properly

📊 Database Tables
events
id, title, description, banner_url

event_date, is_active (defaults to false)

registration_open, form_fields (JSONB)

created_at, created_by (FK to auth.users)

participants
id, event_id (FK), user_id (FK)

responses (JSONB) - stores form submission data

status ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')

created_at, reviewed_by, reviewed_at

admin_users
user_id (PK, FK to auth.users), role ('admin', 'super_admin')

club_name (TEXT) - NEW

club_logo_url (TEXT) - NEW

contact_submissions

profiles

🐛 Troubleshooting
"Relation does not exist" error
Make sure you ran SUPABASE_SETUP.sql in Supabase SQL Editor

Can't login as admin
Create user in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users

Ensure the user's user_id is added to the admin_users table (this is not automatic).

Images not uploading
Check storage buckets exist: event-banners and club-logos.
